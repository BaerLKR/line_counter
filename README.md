# line_counter
A simple program for counting lines in a project directory

## Basic Usage
By just running the program with

    lc

it will simply print out the help information.

In order to count lines in a directory you need to specify a path:

    lc <FILE_PATH>
    
You can also provide the **-s** flag if you want empty lines to be ignored:

    lc -s
