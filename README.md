# line_counter
A simple program for counting lines in a project directory

## Basic Usage
By just running the program with

    lc

it will count every line in the directory and subdirectories recursively.

You can also provide the **-s** flag if you want empty lines to be ignored:

    lc -s


You can also specify the directory or file:

    lc <FILE_PATH>
